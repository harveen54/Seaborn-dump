## Distributions
### Univariate Distribution
* What is an Univariate Distribution?
* Histogram + KDE =  Distplot
* Histograms only
* KDE Only
* Rugplot
* How does KDE works and why it is a very computationally expesnive than histograms. Firstly creating Gaussian at every point , then summation and then normalization is done to bring area less than 1.
* kdeplot
* What is bin size in hist, bandwidth in kde.

### Bivariate Distribution
* Jointplot in Scatter Plots
* Bivariate analog of histogram is Hexbin
* Bivariate version of KDE is contor plot also available in joint plot

### Pairplots
* Pairwise bivariate distribution
